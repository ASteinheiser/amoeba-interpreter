## Local Dev
1. Install [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
1. `git clone https://github.com/ASteinheiser/amoeba-interpreter.git`
1. `cd amoeba-interpreter`
1. `go run main.go`

## Run the test suite
You can run the tests for a sub-module individually as long as it has a `*_test.go` file:
```
go test ./ast/
go test ./lexer/
go test ./parser/
go test ./evaluator/
```
**OR** you can run all the tests at once:
```
./run-tests.sh
```
